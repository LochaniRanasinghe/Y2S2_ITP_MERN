#### Brief Description of Project - 
This repo is about the web application developed for our client "Wireless Waves" mobile phone shop 
management system. Our client has come across numerous problems when using the current manual 
system. Out of all the solutions as the best solution, we chose a web-based application to suit our client's 
needs. The system is composed of 8 major functions namely customer management, employee 
management, inventory management, supplier management, financial management, services 
management, offer management, and branch management. All these major functions have sub-functions 
within them that will replace the manual work that is being done by the client currently. The report 
describes the requirement gathering, designing, and testings we as a group carried out during developing 
this system.
After the testing and evaluation phase ended, we decided that our client‚Äôs problem has been successfully 
resolved and it will satisfy the client's needs.  ü•∞ 

#### Technologies used - MERN
In the implementation of the ‚ÄúWireless Waves‚Äù Phone Management System we used MERN Stack 
technology. The major reason to use these utilities is that it is a trending framework in 2022, as it is 
highly flexible, cost-effective and cloud compatible. Apart from that the other uses are being an opensource technology, full-stack 
development, great community support; making it easier to find answers to all sorts of technical 
questions that may come up
